## 💡 **Challenges & Solutions**

### 🔴 **Challenge: Modals Overlapping**
- **Problem**: Modals were stacking incorrectly, making it hard to use.
- **Solution**: Introduced a **z-index hierarchy** and ensured that only one modal is visible at a time.

### 🟡 **Challenge: Performance Issues on Mobile**
- **Problem**: Too many animations caused lag on lower-end devices.
- **Solution**: **Optimized animations** using GPU-accelerated properties like `transform` instead of `top`/`left`.

### 🟢 **Challenge: Responsive Text Glitches**
- **Problem**: Glitch effects broke on smaller screens.
- **Solution**: Adjusted font sizes and glitch intensity with **media queries**.
